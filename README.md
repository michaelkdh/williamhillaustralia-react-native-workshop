# React Native Workshop
## [William Hill Australia](https://www.williamhill.com.au/)

Before the day of the workshop, please follow the instructions provided in [Prerequisites / Installation](tutorials/1_installation).

The first part of the workshop will include an introduction to React Native, along with initialising our first application.

From there, we'll take a short break for our weekly standup / coffee, followed by jumping straight into extending the application.

We'll work together to build a quick little application using William Hill Australia public endpoints.

The goal of this workshop is to:

1. Understand what React Native is as well as its advantages and disadvantages
1. Build our first application, extend upon it, explore the ecosystem
1. Use cases at William Hill Australia

*Note that the code for the workshop will be open sourced, and available for future references. In this workshop, we won't be going through the basics of React or JavaScript / ES2015+.*
 
*Pull requests welcome. Any feedback is truly appreciated.*
