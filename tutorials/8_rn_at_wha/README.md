# 8. React Native at William Hill Australia

From the learnings of the workshop, hopefully we can see benefits React Native can bring to the business.

React Native can be used at a POC level, as well as supported at a production level.

At William Hill Australia, we use React Native integrated into our iOS and Android native applications for Diversification applications.

- Hi-Lo Racing
- Mystery Bet Pokies
- Rapid Keno Animations

We use TeamCity with CodePush to support over-the-air updates, along with serving content via CDN on initial load - subsequent loads will be cached to device.
